# WP Headless
A lightweight plugin to disable the WP frontend experience.

This enables you to use Wordpress as a backend service without any risk of security issues.

## What the plugin actually does

In simple terms, the plugin removes the frontend of the WordPress site.

## Why would I want to do that?

This is definitely not a useful plugin for a public-facing website. 

This is useful if you use Wordpress as a backend service.
