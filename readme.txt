A lightweight plugin to disable the WP frontend experience.

== Description ==

Logged in users are redirected to the editor screen for the post, while non-logged in users must log in first. This means that you can share a readable link straight to the editor, depending on your permalink settings.

Good for task management or organisation resource management.

## What the plugin actually does

In simple terms, the plugin removes the frontend of the WordPress site. Post permalinks go straight to the editor page, and the theme is mostly redundant.

## Why would I want to do that?

This is definitely not a useful plugin for a public-facing website. Instead, this allows you to convert WordPress into a headless CMS for managing tasks, content and more, all protected by the standard user role system. You can share a post permalink with a collaborator and they will be directed straight to the editor screen.

Maybe you want to go a step further and create an external application to display your WordPress content elsewhere using the API. In this case you definitely don't want the standard WP frontend accessible!
